In this file we will only explain the esentials to get Archlinux running on a system.
 ---- Please follow the Archlinux installation guide as every detail will be explained there and not here  ---
  After mounting the img into a mount point:
# pacstrap /mnt base linux linux-firmware base-devel dhcpcd iwd networkmanager vim nano

Then make all the configurations needed and chroot into the mounted point

We here enable all the needed services : internet for example

# systemctl enable dhcpcd
# systemctl enable iwd / NetworkManager.service

We chose to configure our system with systemd as a bootloader so at the end, before rebooting:

#bootctl install

With that all the system should be properly configured and ready to run on its own.
